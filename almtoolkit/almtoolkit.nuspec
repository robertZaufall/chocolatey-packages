    <description>ALM Toolkit is a free and open-source tool to manage Microsoft Power BI datasets

- Database compare  
What is the Power BI datasets equivalent to relational database compare? There is none. Correction: there is now! ALM Toolit.  

- Code merging  
Merge branched models. Manage production branches for bug fixes. Allow multiple developers to work on the same project (there is one .BIM file).  

- Easy deployment  
Deploy bug fixes and partial releases. Other deployment methods are “all-or-nothing”, which are less flexible. Retain partitions to avoid reprocessing partitioned tables.  

- Source-control integration  
Store dataset metadata in a file and actually check it into source control!  

- Reuse definitions  
Reuse definitions between tabular models for alignment with common business definitions in an enterprise organization.  

- Self-service to corporate BI
Bridge the gap between self-service and corporate BI. Reuse definitions from self-service models to IT-owned semantic models.
